        "1": "If you are online by internet connection you have IP address to send/receive data on websites, which makes your data easy to track or intercept. To protect your data VPN is needed for hiding your IP address and encrypting data. Specifically, there are scenarios when you need a VPN.",
        "2": "You need an internet connection for using a credit card to buy or subscribe where you can not use your private internet connection but use public Wi-Fi, you would need a VPN to protect the data of your credit card, etc. Wi-Fi connections at cafes, hotels, etc would not be safe for being targets for intercepting data of whom uses the insecure connections.",

        "4": "Sometimes you are not sure if the websites you enter are safe or not because some government agencies, and marketers like to track and save your cookie data or browsing history. Such data could be used for advertisement, raising the prices of stuff you could want to buy, or watching you.",
        "5": "Through the tunnel, each packet will be wrapped by the new packet which is encrypted by the VPN server. So data will be encrypted and the IP address is changed to VPNs."
